# led-control-radio-receiver

Listen for numbers broadcast on a pre-defined radio group, and send a signal to the connected NeoPixel lights if that number is greater than a user-defined threshold.

Threshold can be modified in realtime, using the A and B buttons on the microbit.

The current threshold is displayed continuously as a bar chart, but can also be displayed in numerals by pressing both A and B at the same time.

Combine a microbit running this project with another microbit running [acceleration-radio-broadcaster](../acceleration-radio-broadcaster) to switch the LEDs on and off based on the acceleration of the second microbit.

Combine a microbit running this project with another microbit running [manual-radio-broadcaster](../manual-radio-broadcaster) to manually switch the LEDs on and off based on an acceleration value you pick yourself.
