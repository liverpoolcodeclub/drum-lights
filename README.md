# drum-lights

A fun project, built by [Zarino](https://twitter.com/zarino) and [Jackie](https://twitter.com/jackie_pease), for [Batala Mersey](https://www.batalamersey.com)’s 2018 Light Night performance, in collaboration with [Brouhaha](http://www.brouhaha.uk.com/).

12 drummers, wearing a special costume laced with neopixel lights. A microbit attached to the underside of each drum picks up the vibrations caused by hitting the drum, and sends a message to a second microbit attached to the lights, which turns the lights on and off in time with the drumming.

[Hardware instructions](./documentation/hardware.md) – How to put together the neopixel strips, battery boxes, and connecting wires.

[Software instructions](./documentation/software.md) – How to write, compile, and deploy software for the microbits.
