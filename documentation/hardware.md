# Hardware

## Materials

For one complete "kit":

* 2 × microbit
* 2 × AAA double battery packs for microbits
* 2m “NeoPixel” (ws2812b) RGB LED strip, 30 LEDs per metre
* 3 × D-cell battery
* 1 x battery case for 3 D-cell batteries (or, make your own – see below)
* 1 × multi-wire connector of your choice – we used [Valcon 5.08mm PCB power connectors](https://www.toby.co.uk/power-connectors/pcb-power-connectors/3100-valcon-508mm-pitch-crimp-and-housing/), because they had space for all 3 wires (Ground, Live, and Signal), they can be constructed with just a crimping tool, they’re very sturdy, and, once in place, they’re easy to connect and disconnect by hand.
* 3 × 40cm insulated multi-strand electrical wire
   (which we’ll connect to one of the terminals of the battery box, and the Pin 0 and Ground terminals of the microbit)
* 1 × 33cm insulated multi-strand electrical wire
   (which we’ll connect to the _other_ terminal of the battery box – it’s shorter so that, when the wires are taped down, it’ll be the same length as the 40cm one on the other side of the box)
* 3 × 100cm insulated multi-strand electrical wire
   (which we’ll connect to the “NeoPixel” LED strip)
* Heavy duty sticky tape (fibreglass tape is ideal)
* Assorted tools, including:
   * Wire cutter
   * Wire sheath/insulation removal tool
   * Solder and a soldering iron

If you need to build your own 3-cell battery case:

* 3 × battery case for single D-cell battery
* 2 × short length of insulated electrical wire

## General outline

The project comprises three main components (an LED strip, a battery box to power the LEDs, and a microbit with its own power source) connected by electrical wire.

We added a PCB power connector in the middle of those wires, so we could connect and disconnect the lights from their power source, in the field.

We used 3 D-cell batteries because that gets us the 4.5V required to power the LEDs, and contains enough current to drive the LEDs, at full brightness, for at least a half hour performance.
